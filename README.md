# socialObservationStepMotorControl

This is an arduino sketch to control the stepper motors in an insect social arena. The goal is to release animals in a backlit observation arena via an automated program.

The device releases the insect either controlled by the experimentor or via a time scheduled pattern. It can turn on and off other device via TTL pulses, e.g. cameras to record the behaviour.

It was used in Corthals 2017 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00113/full and a full description is currently prepared for another manuscript, including construction plans and sodering maps.
